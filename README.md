# bulk-pdf-workflow
Starter architecture to allow bulk PDF creation from source file for invoices / mail merge etc

When there is a need to rapdily create a simple generic data loading / transform / publish application with a web interface this repo provides a set of tools that can be used as a generic starter.
Ultimately the aim is to provide each architectural component across different technology sets ( Languages / frameworks etc).

# Objectives



# Functional Requirements

* Input source loader: 
* Data Field Validation
* Data Field Tranform
* Document Template
* Document Render

# Proof of Concept Demo / Initial Assumption Validation

Before working on a complete solution I will test my assumptions about the suitability of each of the functional components.

## Source Data Loader

Web page that allows XLS, CSV or Archives to be uploaded into a session.

## HTML5 WYSIWYG-ish Template 

Ideally would want to construct /refine or edit the location of rendered field transform constructs using a html5 canvas. Ideally this would streamline the design and maintenance process.


## PDF Render from Template 

A template was created by taking a staement PDF generated by Xero and modified using Adobe Illustrator.


## Backend Architecture

Currently I have a web server backend with persistence db as a preferred solution. Functional services to perform data to rendered component mapping to be generalised into a SOA integrated using a standardised REST API. This approach allows multiple platforms to be brough together.


# Notes

Using ImageMagick to convert pdf to jpg .. handy for use inside web GUI layout editor.


````bash
convert           \
   -verbose       \
